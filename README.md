# 🧠 Example Python Scripts for Functional Decoding using NiMARE

Welcome to this repository!  
This project provides example Python scripts to perform **functional decoding** using 🧬 [NiMARE](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE).

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following installed or downloaded:

- 🧰 **NiMARE** (and its dependencies)
