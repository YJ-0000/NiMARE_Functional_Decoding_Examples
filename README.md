# 🧠 Example Python Scripts for Meta-analytic Functional Decoding using NiMARE

Welcome to this repository!  
This project provides example Python scripts to perform **meta-analytic functional decoding** using 🧬 [NiMARE](https://nimare.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following installed or downloaded:

- 🧰 **NiMARE** (and its dependencies)  
- ☁️  **wordcloud** [Github repository](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/)
- 🧠 **NeuroMark 2.2 templates** (in `.nii` format)

## 📝 Notes
